# Rock Paper Scissors with Odin

## Objective

Design a basic implemention of rock paper scissors that can be played in the browser console. The game will be played against a computer opponent. The program should include a function with two parameters to indicate the player choice and computer choice. The function will play a five round game and report the winner and loser at the end.

## Task List

- [ ] Design a case-insensitive `playRound()` function that plays a single round of RPS and returns a string which indicates the winner.
- [ ] Write a new function called `game()` which calls `playRound()` to play a five round game of RPS and reports a loser and winner.
